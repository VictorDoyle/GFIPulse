## Setting up

- Make sure you have access to CLI Redis, if you don't run `brew install redis`
- You can check if you have CLI Redis by writing `redis-cli ping` you should get `PONG` back as a response in CLI
- You'll need to setup a DB via `https://cloud.redis.io/#/`.
- Hold onto the following values and set them up in your github secrets or a local .env file:
  - REDIS_HOST
  - REDIS_PORT
  - REDIS_PASSWORD
- Once all three are in your .env or Github Secrets, you should be able to run `npm run start` and it should populate your redis DB with a list of IDs linked to GitHub Issues

## Debugging

- Setup local access to Redis via CLI and run `SMEMBERS fetched_issues` to make sure you're seeing a list of fetched issues
- You can run `SCARD fetched_issues` to view the size of the set of fetched issues
